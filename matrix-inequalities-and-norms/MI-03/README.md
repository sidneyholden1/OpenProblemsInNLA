# MI-03 — Sharp additive triangle constant for an odd number of contractions

**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to specialist  
**Status:** Lean verified
**Last checked:** 2026-09-14

**Rating rationale:** Sharpness for every odd summand count needs a new extremal construction or obstruction; the payoff is concentrated in operator triangle inequalities.

## Resolution — 2026-09-11

**Affirmative result by Matthew J. Colbrook**, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge. **Independent proof review: PASS.**

The sharp additive contraction constant is $`c_k=k/4`$ for every $`k\ge2`$, including every odd summand count. Exact dimension-two extremizers match the universal upper bound.

The exact target is resolved. The original statement and source evidence are retained below; its former difficulty rating is historical.

## Lean proof and verification evidence — 2026-09-14

**The complete original target is Lean verified.** The complete original odd-summand conjecture is proved and, more strongly, the sharp additive contraction constant is k/4 for every k≥2. The formalization uses the actual complex Euclidean operator norm, positive square-root matrix modulus and positive-semidefinite order, with genuine infima of nonempty sets bounded below and exact dimension-two extremizers.

## Problem statement

For each integer $`k\ge2`$, let $`c_k`$ be the infimum of all $`c\ge0`$ such that

```math
\left|\sum_{j=1}^k A_j\right|\preceq cI_n+\sum_{j=1}^k|A_j|
```

for every $`n\ge1`$ and all $`A_1,\ldots,A_k\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}`$ satisfying $`\|A_j\|_2\le1`$. Here $`|A|=(A^*A)^{1/2}`$, $`\|\cdot\|_2`$ denotes the operator norm, and $`X\preceq Y`$ means $`Y-X`$ is positive semidefinite.

Is $`c_k=k/4`$ for every odd integer $`k\ge3`$?

## Why it matters

The scalar absolute-value triangle inequality fails in matrix order. The optimal additive correction quantifies that failure for uniformly bounded summands, in a form usable in positive block-matrix estimates.

## Status check — 2026-09-10

Corollary 4.4 establishes $`c_k\le k/4`$ for every $`k`$ and sharpness for even $`k`$; the source separately conjectures sharpness for all odd $`k>1`$. Its latest version remains v3. Searches included `Bourin Lee contractions odd k constant k/4`, `three contractions 3/4 sharp conjecture`, and `Bourin contractions sharp 2025 2026`. The 2026 symmetric-modulus papers concern different inequalities. No resolution of this additive odd-summand problem was located.

**Audit update (2026-09-10):** Rechecked the conjecture after Remark 4.5 in Bourin–Lee and searched for odd-summand sharpness results. The proved even-summand statement is outside the target, which already restricts to odd $`k`$. This is a bounded literature check, not a proof that no solution exists.
