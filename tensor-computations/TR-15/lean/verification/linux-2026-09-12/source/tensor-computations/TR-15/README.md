# TR-15 — Nonnegative H-eigenvalue inheritance from odd-order Hankel tensors

**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to specialist  
**Rating rationale:** Challenging because odd-order H-eigenvalue positivity lacks the even-order polynomial-positivity argument; specialist importance lies in transferring spectral certificates within Hankel representations.  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-11  
**Status:** Solved

## Resolution — 2026-09-11

**Negative resolution.** Matthew J. Colbrook's [complete manuscript, Counterexample proposition and proof](../../references/colbrook-unclaimed-2026-09-11/manuscripts/TR-15.md) disproves the universal conjecture with $`m=3`$, $`q=2`$, $`n=2`$ and the common generating vector $`h=(2,0,1,0,2,0,-1)`$. Every real H-eigenvalue of the order-three, dimension-three tensor $`A`$ is strictly positive, whereas the order-six, dimension-two tensor $`B`$ has the exact H-eigenpair $`(-1,(0,1))`$. The manuscript also proves that $`A`$ has a real H-eigenpair, so its premise is nonvacuous. The counterexample meets the original odd-lower-order assumptions; it does not contradict the separate even-lower-order theorem or results requiring a positive-semidefinite associated Hankel matrix.

## Statement

For every odd $`m\ge3`$, integer $`q\ge2`$, dimension $`n\ge2`$, and vector $`h\in\mathbb R^{qm(n-1)+1}`$, define Hankel tensors $`A`$ and $`B`$ with this same generating vector. Their orders and dimensions are

```math
\mathop{\mathrm{order}}\nolimits(A)=m,\quad\dim(A)=q(n-1)+1,
\qquad \mathop{\mathrm{order}}\nolimits(B)=qm,\quad\dim(B)=n.
```

An order-$`s`$, dimension-$`N`$ Hankel tensor has entry $`h_{i_1+\cdots+i_s-s}`$, with each index in $`\{1,\ldots,N\}`$.

For a real order-$`s`$ tensor $`C`$, an H-eigenvalue is a real $`\lambda`$ admitting a real nonzero vector $`x`$ such that, for every $`i`$,

```math
\sum_{i_2,\ldots,i_s=1}^N C_{i i_2\cdots i_s}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_s}
=\lambda x_i^{s-1}.
```

Conjecture: if $`A`$ has no negative H-eigenvalues, then $`B`$ has no negative H-eigenvalues.

## Relevance

The question transfers a spectral positivity certificate between different Hankel representations of the same data, relevant to structured tensor eigenvalue computation and polynomial positivity.

## Status check — 2026-09-10

Rechecked the [Ding–Qi–Wei journal text, final §4](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/staff/new/qilq/BIT-DQW.pdf), and searched for proofs or counterexamples to the third inheritance property. The source explicitly leaves odd lower order unresolved; its even-lower-order result lies outside the displayed target. Complete or strong Hankel hypotheses would be additional restrictions. No later resolution was located; this remains a bounded historical-source check.
