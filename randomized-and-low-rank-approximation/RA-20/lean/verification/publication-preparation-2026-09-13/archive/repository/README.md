# Open Problems in Numerical Linear Algebra

A collection of precise open problems drawn from books and research
publications, with references and dated checks for subsequent solutions.

<!-- catalog-summary -->
**125 problems with open targets:** 53 open and 72 partially resolved. **92 other retained entries**, excluded from the open count.

**Resolution evidence:** 76 solved (published or independently audited); 16 Lean verified.

Each entry records its own literature-check date. Literature checks are bounded; ratings are editorial. “Impact” uses the canonical `Importance` field.

Open a category, then a problem folder. Every problem has three files:

- **`README.md`** — the canonical statement, rendered directly on GitHub.
- **`problem.pdf`** — a typeset document for reading, downloading, or printing.
- **`problem.tex`** — standalone LaTeX source for the PDF.

Shared definitions are included in each problem so it can be read independently.
**Published problem numbers are permanent.** Solving or withdrawing a problem
changes its status and the open-problem count, never its ID. We retain its
original statement and canonical page, including when category listings change.
The append-only [ID registry](problem_ids.json) and automated checks prevent
renumbering, removal, path reassignment, and reuse; new IDs extend their prefix's
numbering without filling gaps. See [the contribution rules](CONTRIBUTING.md#permanent-problem-ids).

Each problem gives its assumptions and quantifiers, one difficulty label, one
importance rating, a brief set of references, and a literature-status check.
The collection includes core NLA and directly relevant matrix theory and
computational complexity. Entries explain that connection where it is less
immediate. Resolution arguments are recorded with their verification level;
[MI-13](matrix-inequalities-and-norms/MI-13/README.md) includes a complete proof.

## Ratings

Ratings are provisional editorial judgments. They describe the mathematical
scope and expected difficulty, rather than estimating a completion time.

| Difficulty | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **hard** | A focused unresolved question requiring substantial technical work within an established setting. |
| **challenging** | A substantial obstruction, new analysis, or new algorithm appears necessary; the statement spans a meaningful class of inputs. |
| **extreme** | A foundational or very general question with major theoretical obstacles, or a longstanding barrier at the frontier of the subject. |

| Importance | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **interesting to specialist** | Primarily advances a specific method, matrix class, or technical subfield. |
| **interesting to the community** | Relevant to a substantial part of the NLA community or to several numerical methods. |
| **broadly interesting** | Consequences extend across NLA and into other major areas of mathematics, computation, or applications. |

## Problem status

Status is separate from difficulty and impact and appears on every problem,
PDF and index row. A solved problem keeps its ID and original statement; its
page records the outcome, date and exact resolution reference.

| Display | Meaning | Counted as open? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔵 **OPEN** | The stated target remains unresolved in the checked literature. | Yes |
| 🟡 **PARTIAL** | Substantive cases inside the displayed target are proved; the entry identifies the remaining cases. This may reflect older results, not necessarily a new discovery. | Yes, once |
| 🟠 **SOLUTION CLAIMED** | A primary manuscript claims a complete resolution; its full proof has not been independently verified here. | No |
| ✅ **SOLVED** | A published result or an independently audited argument settles the exact target, affirmatively or by a counterexample. An AI-agent audit can support this status; it does not establish formal verification. | No |
| 🏆 **LEAN VERIFIED** | A Lean proof of the exact target has passed kernel checking, with reviewed statement correspondence and a reproducible verification record. This is the formal-verification level above Solved. | No |
| ⚪ **NEEDS VERIFICATION** | A material statement or status issue prevents admission. This is not a claim that the problem is solved. | No |
| ⚫ **WITHDRAWN** | A retained original entry explains why it was withdrawn; its ID and canonical page remain reserved. | No |

For complete resolutions, the evidence levels are **Solution claimed → Solved →
Lean verified**. An agent finding no error is an informal audit, not a proof
certificate or external human peer review. Each resolution records the kind
and scope of review actually performed. `Solved` alone makes no claim of Lean
verification; promotion requires the [Lean evidence requirements](CONTRIBUTING.md#lean-verification).
A Lean proof of only a special case does not promote the whole problem; if
cases remain open, its status stays `Partially resolved`.
Lean checks the formal statement; its correspondence to the original
mathematical target still requires review.

We retain older-source entries when the exact question is supported and no
resolution was found, but explicitly flag the limits of that evidence. An
improved bound or a result for a different algorithm or model is not a full
resolution. See [solved problems and solution claims](RESOLVED.md) for the archive
and the procedure for reporting a solution.

## What “open” means here

The latest full-catalog audit date is **2026-09-10**. A historical open-problem citation
is checked against subsequent publications and targeted searches. The entry
records what was checked and distinguishes known special cases from the
remaining question. A search that finds no resolution cannot guarantee that
none exists, especially for older or less widely indexed sources.

Resolved questions, recent full-solution claims, and candidates with unclear
statements or status are kept outside the count. The [supporting references](references/README.md)
document source coverage, excluded candidates and the status audit.
Clearly identified quantitative restatements are editorial formulations of
published questions, rather than quotations attributed to their authors.

The [full status and rating audit](references/STATUS-AUDIT-2026-09-10.md) covers every entry present at that date.
Every pair of ratings has a short rationale.

## Contributing

Suggestions, references and corrections are welcome through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ajt60gaibb/OpenProblemsInNLA/issues) and pull requests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for admission criteria, editing and PDF generation, and the [correction or resolution template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/correction_or_resolution.md) for reporting a solution. A closed issue is not a mathematical status label; the canonical entry and indexes show whether a problem is solved.
