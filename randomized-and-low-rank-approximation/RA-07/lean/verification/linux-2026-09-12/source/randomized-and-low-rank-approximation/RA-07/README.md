# RA-07 — Convexity of the expected error of volume-sampled column subsets

**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to the community  
**Rating rationale:** Challenging because the required second-difference inequality goes beyond standard log-concavity; community impact is understanding average column-selection and Nyström error.  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-11  

**Status:** Solved

**Author:** Matthew J. Colbrook, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge. **Independent Codex-agent review: PASS for the exact target.**

The sequence $`(j+1)e_{j+1}/e_j`$ is decreasing and discretely convex for every positive spectrum, including both endpoints. The exact second-difference certificate proves the full canonical conjecture.

The complete target is resolved. Its former difficulty rating is historical; the original mathematical statement and source evidence are retained below.

For $`n\geq3`$ and positive real numbers $`\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n`$, let

```math
e_j(\lambda)=\sum_{\substack{S\subseteq\{1,\ldots,n\}\\|S|=j}}
\prod_{i\in S}\lambda_i,
\qquad e_0=1,\quad e_{n+1}=0.
```

Define $`f(j)=(j+1)e_{j+1}(\lambda)/e_j(\lambda)`$ for $`1\leq j\leq n`$. Is $`f`$ discretely convex, that is,

```math
f(j-1)-2f(j)+f(j+1)\geq0
\qquad(2\leq j\leq n-1),
```

for every such $`n`$ and positive tuple $`\lambda`$?

For a matrix $`A`$ with positive eigenvalues $`\lambda_i`$ of $`A^TA`$, sample a set $`S`$ of $`j`$ columns with probability proportional to $`\det(A_S^TA_S)`$. Its expected squared Frobenius projection error is

```math
\mathbb E\|(I-P_{A_S})A\|_F^2=f(j),
```

where $`P_{A_S}`$ is the orthogonal projector onto the selected column span. Thus the conjecture asserts a diminishing marginal improvement in the average reconstruction error of these fixed-size determinantal samples. It is distinct from optimizing a worst-case approximation factor over all matrices with a prescribed spectrum.

## Status check — 2026-09-08

Searched “Derezinski Khanna Mahoney Conjecture 1 convexity”, “elementary symmetric ratio $`k+1`$ convexity DPP”, and the exact 2020 paper title with 2025/2026. Checked the current arXiv record. No proof or counterexample was found. Standard Newton inequalities imply other ratio inequalities but are not cited as a resolution of this second-difference inequality.

## Audit — 2026-09-10

Rechecked [Dereziński–Khanna–Mahoney, §5, Conjecture 1](https://arxiv.org/html/2002.09073); the current record remains v3 of December 2020. Volume-sampling convexity and elementary-symmetric-ratio searches found no resolution. This remains historical explicit conjecture evidence, supplemented by a bounded follow-up search.
