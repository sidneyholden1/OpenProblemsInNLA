This manuscript gives a negative resolution of the complete IE-04 inequality. The [independent complete-proof review](../../references/stepaniants-ie04-2026-09-11/verification/IE-04-independent-review.md) returned PASS on the recovered source. This is AI-assisted work with independent automated-agent review; no external human peer review, formal proof-assistant certification, or novelty determination is claimed. The [submission record](../../references/stepaniants-ie04-2026-09-11/README.md) preserves the supplied draft, exact checks, and public eligibility evidence.

## Statement and conclusion

IE-04 asks for universal $c_1,c_2>0$ such that, for every admissible dimension, deterministic center, noise level, and $x\geq1$,

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\Pr\{\rho_{\rm PP}(\bar A+\sigma G)>x(n/\sigma)^{c_1}\}
\leq 2^{-c_2x},
\tag{1}
$$

where $\|\bar A\|_2\leq1$, $0<\sigma\leq1$, and $G$ has independent real standard normal entries [1]. The growth factor is the largest absolute entry among all active Schur complements, divided by the largest absolute input entry. Elimination is in exact arithmetic.

**Theorem.** For every $n\geq2$ and either $C=0$ or $C=I_n$, a standard Gaussian matrix $G$ satisfies

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\Pr\!\left\{\rho_{\rm PP}(C+G)>
\frac12\left(\frac32\right)^{n-1}\right\}
\geq 2^{-n^2(n^2+n+5)}
\geq 2^{-3n^4}.
\tag{2}
$$

Consequently, (1) is false for every choice of positive constants $c_1,c_2$. The case $\bar A=I_n$, $\sigma=1$ already contradicts it. This deterministic center is nonsingular and has spectral norm one.

The point is the requirement of an exponential tail in **every** $x\geq1$. An exponentially large growth factor has at least an inverse-exponential-in-a-polynomial-of-$n$ probability; the proposed right-hand side at the corresponding $x$ is much smaller. This does not deny a polynomial growth bound with high probability, or settle a different tail estimate restricted to a smaller range of $x$.

## A strictly pivoted high-growth matrix

Define $W_n=(w_{ij})$ by

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
w_{ij}=\begin{cases}
1,&j=n,\\
1,&j<n\text{ and }i=j,\\
-1/2,&j<n\text{ and }i>j,\\
0,&j<n\text{ and }i<j.
\end{cases}
\tag{3}
$$

For example, its order-four instance is

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
W_4=\begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0&1\\
-1/2&1&0&1\\
-1/2&-1/2&1&1\\
-1/2&-1/2&-1/2&1
\end{pmatrix}.
$$

At elimination step $k<n$, the pivot is $1$ and every competitor in the pivot column is $-1/2$. Thus partial pivoting uniquely chooses the current row. The other nonfinal columns keep the same triangular pattern. In the final column, all remaining entries have a common value $c_k$, and a step changes this to $c_k-(-1/2)c_k=(3/2)c_k$. Hence

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
c_k=\left(\frac32\right)^{k-1},\qquad
\rho_{\rm PP}(W_n)=c_n.
\tag{4}
$$

In particular, $W_n$ is nonsingular. All entries of every exact active matrix have absolute value at most $2^n$.

## Quantitative robustness on a full entrywise box

Set

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
B_n=2^{n+2},\qquad \delta_n=2^{-(n^2+n+1)}.
\tag{5}
$$

These constants satisfy

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
B_n^{n-1}\delta_n=\frac18.
\tag{6}
$$

**Lemma.** Every real matrix $A$ with $\|A-W_n\|_{\max}\leq\delta_n$ is nonsingular, has a unique no-swap partial-pivoting path, and satisfies

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\rho_{\rm PP}(A)>\frac{c_n}{2}.
\tag{7}
$$

**Proof.** Denote the active Schur complements of $W_n$ and $A$ by $S_k$ and $T_k$. We prove by induction that the same no-swap path is selected and

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
e_k:=\|T_k-S_k\|_{\max}\leq B_n^{k-1}\delta_n\leq\frac18.
\tag{8}
$$

The initial claim follows from the box condition. Suppose it holds at step $k<n$; retain the original global indices on the active entries. The perturbed pivot has value at least $1-e_k\geq7/8$, while every competing entry has absolute value at most $1/2+e_k\leq5/8$. The pivot is therefore strictly largest and positive.

Write $b=-1/2$ for the unperturbed elimination multiplier in a remaining row, and $q=(T_k)_{ik}/(T_k)_{kk}$ for its perturbed value. For $e=e_k\leq1/8$,

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
|q|\leq\frac{1/2+e}{1-e}\leq\frac57<1,
\qquad
|q-b|\leq\frac{(3/2)e}{1-e}\leq2e.
\tag{9}
$$

For each remaining $(i,j)$, subtracting the two exact update formulas gives

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\begin{aligned}
(T_{k+1}-S_{k+1})_{ij}
={}&(T_k-S_k)_{ij}
-q(T_k-S_k)_{kj}\\
&-(q-b)(S_k)_{kj}.
\end{aligned}
\tag{10}
$$

Using $|(S_k)_{kj}|\leq2^n$ and (9),

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
e_{k+1}\leq (2+2^{n+1})e_k\leq B_ne_k.
\tag{11}
$$

This proves the induction, including the strict pivot selection at every nonfinal step. The final scalar Schur complement is at least $c_n-1/8>0$, so all pivots are nonzero and $A$ is nonsingular. Also $\|A\|_{\max}\leq1+\delta_n\leq9/8$. Consequently,

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\rho_{\rm PP}(A)\geq\frac{c_n-1/8}{1+\delta_n}
\geq\frac{8c_n-1}{9}\geq\frac{7c_n}{9}>\frac{c_n}{2},
\tag{12}
$$

where $c_n\geq1$ was used. This proves the lemma. Notice that the statement concerns the entire box, not sampled perturbations, and uses no unspecified continuity radius.

## Gaussian probability of the box

Fix $C\in\{0,I_n\}$ and set $A=C+G$. Define the event

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
E_n=\{\,|G_{ij}-(w_{ij}-C_{ij})|\leq\delta_n
\text{ for every }i,j\,\}.
\tag{13}
$$

On $E_n$, the matrix $A=C+G$ belongs to the box around $W_n$ in the lemma. For the smoothed counterexample we use $C=I_n$, so $\bar A=I_n$ and $\sigma=1$. This obeys $\|\bar A\|_2=1$ and even a requirement that the deterministic center be nonsingular. The matrix $W_n$ is only the center of the high-growth event in input space; there is no requirement that $\|W_n\|_2\leq1$. The case $C=0$ gives an additional pure-Gaussian statement but is not needed for the counterexample.

Each interval in (13) lies within $[-2,2]$, because $|w_{ij}-C_{ij}|\leq1$ for both choices of $C$, and $\delta_n\leq1/8$. The standard normal density there is bounded below by

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\frac{e^{-2}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}>\frac1{32}.
\tag{14}
$$

For instance, $e<3$ and $\pi<4$ imply that the left side exceeds $1/27$. Each interval has length $2\delta_n$, and the entries are independent. It follows that

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\Pr(E_n)\geq\left(\frac{\delta_n}{16}\right)^{n^2}
=2^{-n^2(n^2+n+5)}.
\tag{15}
$$

The lemma gives $E_n\subseteq\{\rho_{\rm PP}(C+G)>c_n/2\}$. Finally, $n^2(n^2+n+5)\leq3n^4$ for $n\geq2$: subtracting gives $n^2(2n^2-n-5)>0$. This proves (2).

## Contradiction for arbitrary proposed constants

Let $c_1,c_2>0$ be arbitrary. Put

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
x_n=\frac{(3/2)^{n-1}}{2n^{c_1}},
\qquad K_n=n^2(n^2+n+5).
\tag{16}
$$

Exponential growth dominates every fixed power of $n$, so $x_n\geq1$ and $c_2x_n>K_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$. More explicitly,

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\log\frac{x_n}{K_n}
=(n-1)\log(3/2)-(c_1+4)\log n-\log2
-\log(1+1/n+5/n^2)\longrightarrow+\infty.
\tag{17}
$$

For such $n$, (2) with $C=I_n$ yields

\nopagebreak[4]

$$
\Pr\{\rho_{\rm PP}(I_n+G)>x_nn^{c_1}\}
\geq2^{-K_n}>2^{-c_2x_n},
\tag{18}
$$

contradicting (1) in an admissible instance. Thus no pair of universal positive constants can satisfy the displayed IE-04 inequality.

## Verification, scope, and provenance

This is an analytic proof for every dimension and every proposed pair of constants. The accompanying `verify_bounds.py` supplies additional exact checks: the default run certifies the **whole** entrywise box for each $n=2,\ldots,16$ by outward-rounded dyadic interval arithmetic, verifies the scalar bounds for $n=2,\ldots,256$, and gives illustrative exact contradiction dimensions for several selected constants. These finite checks do not replace the universal argument above. They require only Python's standard library.

```
python verify_bounds.py
```

`certificate.json` and `verification.txt` record the successful run. The earlier interrupted work contained the high-growth/small-box proof outline; this explicit version, including the constants and all inequalities, was completed and checked during recovery. The argument was developed with substantial ChatGPT/Codex assistance at the author's request. A separate independent Codex-agent review returned PASS for the complete canonical target; the signed report is preserved in the submission record. No external human peer review, formal proof-assistant certification, or novelty/priority determination is claimed.

The conclusion concerns precisely (1), with its unrestricted $x\geq1$. It does not produce an alternative optimal smoothed tail, resolve growth expectations, or identify a sharp high-probability polynomial exponent. The historical motivation appears in [2], Conjecture 16; the canonical repository formulation is the target certified here.
