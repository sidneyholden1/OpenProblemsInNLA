## Independently reviewed resolution - 2026-09-11

**Negative resolution.** Theorem 1 gives a $`2\times3`$ full-row-rank matrix with distinct norm-minimizing right inverses for every $`2< p<\infty`$ over both fields. Their common induced norm is $`2^{1/2-1/p}`$. Sections 3-4 identify the complete minimizer sets, including a complex higher-dimensional family. The smallest matrix is attributed to Dokmanic and Gribonval\'s spectral-norm example; its extension to the displayed direct-inverse objective is checked. No conclusion about the separate product objective is claimed.

**Rating rationale:** Hard reflects a focused uniqueness question for a known norm minimizer; specialist impact is the characterization of generalized inverses under induced norms.

## Problem statement

Let $`1\le m< n`$, let $`A\in\mathbb C^{m\times n}`$ have rank $`m`$, and let $`2< p<\infty`$. For $`X\in\mathbb C^{n\times m}`$ define the induced norm

```math
\|X\|_{p\to2}=\sup_{y\in\mathbb C^m\setminus\{0\}}
\frac{\|Xy\|_2}{\bigl(\sum_{i=1}^m|y_i|^p\bigr)^{1/p}}.
```

The Moore–Penrose inverse $`A^\dagger=A^*(AA^*)^{-1}`$ minimizes this norm among the right inverses $`X`$ satisfying $`AX=I_m`$. Is it always the unique minimizer? Equivalently, must

```math
AX=I_m,\quad X\ne A^\dagger
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\|X\|_{p\to2}>\|A^\dagger\|_{p\to2}
```

hold for every such $`A,p,X`$?

This is the direct-inverse uniqueness question in Dokmanić–Gribonval's Remark 4.1. The endpoints and the separate objective $`\|XA\|_{p\to2}`$ are outside this statement.

## Connection to numerical linear algebra

The norm measures the worst Euclidean solution amplification for right-hand sides bounded in $`\ell^p`$. Uniqueness determines whether another linear solver can match the Moore–Penrose inverse's optimal amplification while changing its sparsity or structure.

## Earlier status check — 2026-09-08

Checked the complete v2 statement and version history on 2026-09-08; v2, dated 2017-07-13, remains the latest arXiv version of Part I. Searches combined the authors, the paper title, “induced norm”, “p to 2”, “unique”, “uniqueness”, “generalized inverse”, and 2025/2026. The companion paper's sparse-inverse uniqueness results concern entrywise norms and generic inputs, not this induced-norm claim for every full-row-rank matrix. No later proof or counterexample was located. This bounded search does not certify that no resolution exists elsewhere.

## Audit update — 2026-09-10

The [author copy of Part I](https://dokmanic.ece.illinois.edu/assets/pdf/DokmanicG17aa.pdf), Corollary 4.2(3) and Remark 4.1 on printed p. 18, explicitly separates minimality from the remaining uniqueness question for $`2< p<\infty`$. Searches for later induced-$`p`$-to-2 uniqueness results found no resolution; Part II's sparse-inverse objectives do not supply this missing assertion.
