## Independently reviewed resolution - 2026-09-11

**Negative resolution.** Sections 1-4 give one exact full-column-rank $`4\times3`$ LSMR example for which both displayed errors increase from the first to the second nonzero iterate. The matrix-only spectral backward error satisfies $`\mu(x_1)^2\le1979/2000<99/100<\mu(x_2)^2`$, and the specified approximation also strictly increases. The right-hand side stays fixed. This settles the canonical spectral-norm formulation; the cited SISC paper uses a different default norm convention, so no Frobenius-error conclusion is inferred.

**Rating rationale:** Challenging reflects monotonicity of an optimization-defined error along coupled Krylov iterates; community impact is a stopping and reliability guarantee for a widely used least-squares method.

## Lean proof and verification evidence — 2026-09-14

**Both original monotonicity claims have Lean-verified negative answers.** The complete pair of monotonicity claims is disproved by the exact first two nonzero iterates of undamped, zero-initial-guess LSMR on a real 4-by-3 system. The formalization proves the genuine minimum-length normal-residual minimizers over the Krylov spaces, the matrix-only spectral backward-error infimum and attainment, and the prescribed Moore–Penrose projector approximation. Both errors strictly increase; the right-hand side remains fixed.

Let $`A\in\mathbb R^{m\times n}`$ and $`b\in\mathbb R^m`$. In exact arithmetic, start LSMR at $`x_0=0`$: equivalently, $`x_k`$ minimizes $`\|A^T(b-Ax)\|_2`$ over $`\mathcal K_k(A^TA,A^Tb)`$. Work up to its exact termination and use its minimum-length iterate if necessary. Let $`r=b-Ax`$ and define the matrix-only normwise backward error

```math
\mu(x)=\min\{\|E\|_2:(A+E)^T((A+E)x-b)=0\}.
```

For $`x\ne0`$, put $`K_x=[A^T,\,(\|r\|_2/\|x\|_2)I]^T`$, $`v_x=[r^T,0^T]^T`$, and

```math
\widetilde\mu(x)=\frac{\|K_xK_x^{\dagger}v_x\|_2}{\|x\|_2}.
```

Here $`\dagger`$ is the Moore–Penrose inverse; at an exact least-squares solution set both errors to zero.

Are both sequences $`\mu(x_k)`$ and $`\widetilde\mu(x_k)`$ nonincreasing, for successive nonzero LSMR iterates? These two closely related claims are counted together, as in the source. The right-hand side $`b`$ is kept fixed in the backward-error model.

A positive answer would justify backward-error stopping decisions without a later iteration making the current iterate less backward accurate. The known monotonicity of $`\|r_k\|_2`$ and $`\|A^Tr_k\|_2`$ does not establish this statement.

## Status check — 2026-09-08

 Exact-title and “LSMR optimal backward error monotonicity conjecture/proof/counterexample” searches found no resolution. The LSMB2018 discussion of nonmonotonicity concerns LSQR, and its proposed method differs from LSMR. Hallman's May 2026 arXiv:2605.09211 develops backward-error formulas and estimates, without resolving this iterate-monotonicity conjecture. No recent explicit reaffirmation was located.

## Audit update — 2026-09-10

Rechecked Fong's [dissertation](https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/dissertations/david-fong-thesis-online.pdf), §7.2.1, printed p. 118, which separately conjectures monotonicity of both displayed errors. [Hallman (2026)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.09211) studies a variational equation and lower bound for the backward error; it does not assert this iterate monotonicity. Searches for LSMR optimal-backward-error monotonicity located no proof or counterexample.
