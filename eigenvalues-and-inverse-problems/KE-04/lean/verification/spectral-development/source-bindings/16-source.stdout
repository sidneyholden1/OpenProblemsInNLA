# KE-04 — Strict interlacing across block Lanczos iterations

**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to the community  
**Status:** Open  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-10  

**Rating rationale:** Challenging reflects a stronger strict interlacing law than general compression interlacing supplies; community impact is spectral information across block Krylov iterations.

Let $A\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}$ be symmetric and $V\in\mathbb R^{n\times p}$ have full column rank. Write
$$
\mathcal K_j=\operatorname{range}[V,AV,\ldots,A^{j-1}V],
$$
and let $s$ be the largest integer with $\dim\mathcal K_s=sp$. For $1\le j\le s$, choose an orthonormal basis $Q_j$ of $\mathcal K_j$ and order the eigenvalues of $T_j=Q_j^TAQ_j$ as
$\theta_1^{(j)}\le\cdots\le\theta_{jp}^{(j)}$, with multiplicity.

For every $1\le k<j\le s$ and $1\le i\le(k-1)p$, must the open interval
$$
(\theta_i^{(k)},\theta_{i+p}^{(k)})
$$
contain an eigenvalue of $T_j$? The statement concerns exact arithmetic before the first loss of full block dimension. Although Lanczos supplies compatible block tridiagonal representations, the spectra do not depend on the chosen bases.

This would extend a scalar Lanczos property used to interpret later Ritz values and distinguish genuine eigenvalue approximation from clusters created by finite precision.

## Status check — 2026-09-08

 The arXiv abstract/history and full §2.1 were inspected; v1 remains the only listed version. Searches “block Lanczos interlacing conjecture”, “Šimonová Tichý interlacing”, and 2026 proof/counterexample queries found no resolution. Standard weak Cauchy interlacing is not the asserted strict interval-occupancy result.

## Audit update — 2026-09-10

Rechecked the explicit conjecture and concluding discussion in the [2025 block-Lanczos manuscript](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.16484v1). Its block-width index ranges agree with this entry. Searches for later strict block-Lanczos interlacing proofs found no resolution; ordinary Cauchy interlacing is weaker than the displayed claim.
