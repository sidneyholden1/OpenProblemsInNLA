**Topic:** Structured eigenvalue problems and semidefinite optimization.  
**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to the community  
**Status:** Lean verified  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-22  

**Rating rationale:** Challenging reflects a structured minimum-eigenvalue comparison for arbitrary positive definite pairs; community impact connects Kronecker eigenproblems and semidefinite optimization.

## Resolution — 2026-09-11

**Affirmative resolution by Matthew J. Colbrook** (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge). See the [complete manuscript](solution.md), **Theorem SP-05, sections 1–3** ([PDF](solution.pdf) · [LaTeX](solution.tex)), prepared 11 September 2026.

For arbitrary real symmetric positive definite $`A,B`$, a nonzero real positive-semidefinite eigenmatrix attains the smallest eigenvalue of $`X\mapsto AXB+BXA`$. Section 3 derives the exact symmetric/skew-symmetric Rayleigh-quotient inequality in the original target, without commutativity, rank restrictions or a simple-eigenvalue assumption.

The original proof draft was generated in a ChatGPT conversation. A separate Codex agent independently verified the full proof and its match to the exact target on 11 September 2026: [detailed PASS review](../../references/colbrook-2026-09-11/verification/reviews/SP-05-review.md). The review records a hash of the unchanged proof text. This is independent agent verification, not external human peer review or formal certification. [The submission history and diagnostic record](../../references/colbrook-2026-09-11/README.md) preserve the initial solution claim. The ratings above are historical, and the earlier literature checks below are retained.

## Lean verification — 22 September 2026

The full original inequality is formally proved for every dimension at least two and every real symmetric positive-definite pair. The proof constructs a nonzero real PSD global minimizing eigenmatrix and establishes that both actual sector minima exist and are attained. All four exports passed LeanCert kernel audits, two independent nonauthor final reviews, and [fresh isolated Linux Comparator/default-kernel verification](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/actions/runs/35693379965) at the [immutable proof revision](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/tree/8596dc32d33c931de352aace53df8f02a67602ce/eigenvalues-and-inverse-problems/SP-05/lean).

Mathematical resolution: Matthew J. Colbrook. Original conjecture: Kalantarova and Tunçel. Formalization: Sidney Holden with OpenAI Codex assistance. The retained checks include rejection and sandbox controls; AI-agent reviews are not external human peer review.

## Problem statement

Let $`n\ge 2`$ and let $`A,B\in\mathbb R^{n\times n}`$ be symmetric positive definite. Let $`T\in\mathbb R^{n^2\times n^2}`$ be the commutation matrix defined by $`T\mathop{\mathrm{vec}}\nolimits(X)=\mathop{\mathrm{vec}}\nolimits(X^T)`$, where $`\mathop{\mathrm{vec}}\nolimits`$ stacks columns. Is it always true that

```math
\min_{\substack{u\in\mathbb R^{n^2}\setminus\{0\}\\Tu=u}}
\frac{u^T(A\otimes B)u}{u^Tu}
\;\le\;
\min_{\substack{w\in\mathbb R^{n^2}\setminus\{0\}\\Tw=-w}}
\frac{w^T(A\otimes B)w}{w^Tw}?
```

Equivalently, must the smallest eigenvalue of $`A\otimes B+B\otimes A`$ have an eigenvector $`\mathop{\mathrm{vec}}\nolimits(X)`$ with $`X=X^T\ne0`$?

## Why it matters

An affirmative answer would identify which invariant subspace contains the smallest eigenvalue of an important structured matrix operator, relevant to positivity checks in semidefinite optimization.

## Earlier status check — 2026-09-08

On 2026-09-08, checked arXiv v3 (2020-08-08, still the latest listed version) and searched combinations of “Jordan-Kronecker”, “positive definite”, “conjecture”, “smallest”, “counterexample”, and the authors' names, including 2025–2026 results. No resolution of Conjecture 1 was located. The source's counterexamples to general symmetric-matrix interlacing do not dispose of its separately stated positive definite conjecture. The August 2026 Lyapunov result concerns an operator norm maximizer, rather than this positive definite Jordan–Kronecker minimum. No recent explicit reaffirmation of this exact conjecture was found; the status evidence is therefore bounded.

## Audit update — 2026-09-10

Rechecked the [author manuscript](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ltuncel/publications/1805.09737.pdf), Conjecture 1 and equation (7). Its positive definite, minimum-eigenvalue formulation matches this entry. Searches for the Jordan–Kronecker symmetric-minimizer conjecture and later counterexamples found no resolution. Results for indefinite inputs or a maximum-eigenvalue objective do not settle the displayed claim.
