**Sharp growth classification.** Theorem 1 and Sections 2-4 prove $`G(0,q)=1`$ and $`G(p,q)=h_{p+q}`$ for $`p\ge1`$, where $`h_t=0`$ for $`t\le0`$ and $`h_t=1+\sum_{r=1}^p h_{t-r}`$ otherwise. The upper bound covers every complex input and admissible tie path, with growth over all active entries in the fixed original ordering. A real nonsingular matrix of order $`2p+q+1`$ attains it, including zero upper bandwidth.

**Rating rationale:** Challenging reflects interacting fill-in and pivot choices across arbitrary unequal bandwidths; specialist impact is a sharp stability classification for banded elimination.

## Problem statement

Work in exact arithmetic over $`\mathbb C`$. For integers $`p,q\ge0`$, define

```math
\mathcal B_n(p,q)=\{A\in\mathbb C^{n\times n}:\det A\ne0,\quad
a_{ij}=0\text{ if }i-j>p\text{ or }j-i>q\}.
```

Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) chooses a largest-modulus entry in the active first column, moves its row to the first position, and forms the trailing Schur complement. For a permitted path $`\pi`$, let $`S_1=A,\ldots,S_n`$ be its active matrices and define

```math
\rho(A,\pi)=\frac{\max_{1\le k\le n}\|S_k\|_{\max}}{\|A\|_{\max}},
\qquad \|M\|_{\max}=\max_{i,j}|m_{ij}|.
```

Determine, for all $`p\ne q`$, the sharp bound independent of dimension,

```math
G(p,q)=\sup_{n\ge1+\max(p,q)}\ \sup_{A\in\mathcal B_n(p,q)}\
\sup_{\pi\text{ permitted by GEPP}}\rho(A,\pi).
```

Identify the least universal upper bound and matching examples approaching it. All tie choices are included. The bandwidth restrictions apply in the given ordering; no reordering before GEPP is allowed. Bandwidths are *at most* $`p`$ and $`q`$; unequal pairs with one zero bandwidth are included. For $`p\ge1`$, the equal-bandwidth case is known:

```math
G(p,p)=2^{2p-1}-(p-1)2^{p-2}.
```

This asks how unequal bandwidths affect worst-case element growth in banded linear solves. All unequal pairs constitute one problem.

## Earlier status check — 2026-09-08

The book's problem was checked directly. Its wording omits the field; this entry adopts $`\mathbb C`$ from its referenced Theorem 9.11. Searches for `Higham 9.15 growth`, `growth factor lower bandwidth upper bandwidth`, and `Bohte Gaussian 1975` found no general unequal-bandwidth solution. Shah–Urschel's [August 31, 2026 revision](https://arxiv.org/html/2608.19189v4), Theorems 2.2–2.3, studies sparsity constraints without determining this extremal function. No recent explicit reaffirmation of this particular question's openness was located; the status rests on the original question and this bounded later-literature check.

## Audit update — 2026-09-10

Higham's [Problem 9.15(a)](https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~bwu62/771/hingham2002.pdf), p. 193, remains the explicit historical source. Unequal-bandwidth and sharp-growth searches, including the [August 2026 complete-pivoting manuscript](https://arxiv.org/html/2608.19189v4), did not identify a sharp answer for this partial-pivoting sparsity pattern. This is a bounded historical-source assessment, without a recent explicit reaffirmation.
