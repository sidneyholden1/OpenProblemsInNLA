**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to the community  
**Rating rationale:** Challenging because optimal cubic compositions must be compared with unrestricted evaluation programs; community impact comes from reusable matrix-sign iterations.  
**Status:** Lean verified  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-22  

## Lean verification — 22 September 2026

The full canonical uniform stage bound is formally proved for every multiplication budget and every real gap in (0,1), including both small-budget endpoints. Seven exports establish actual register-program costs, genuine approximation errors and least feasible stage counts. They passed LeanCert kernel audits, two independent nonauthor final reviews, and [fresh isolated Linux Comparator/default-kernel verification](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/actions/runs/35693827256) with rejection and sandbox controls.

[Proof and reviews](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/blob/main/matrix-functions-and-stability/MF-02/lean/README.md) · [Immutable proof revision](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/tree/9aba1c7fed69ad95023b217a28cb486a7b9983ef/matrix-functions-and-stability/MF-02/lean) · [Retained Linux evidence](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/blob/main/docs/lean/verification-2026-09-22/MF-02/README.md). Exposition: George Stepaniants; prior asymptotic order: Cheon–Kim–Kim; cubic construction: Chen–Chow. Formalization: Sidney Holden with OpenAI Codex assistance. This verifies the stated uniform asymptotic order; no novelty, exact optimum, same-budget optimality or external human peer review is claimed.

## Resolution - uniform constant-factor asymptotic order

**Resolution recorded 2026-09-12.** The canonical asymptotic-order target is settled:

```math
T_{\min}(m,\delta)=\Theta(m+1)\qquad(0<\delta<1),
```

with absolute constants uniform in the gap, including gaps depending on the multiplication budget. The [Theorem in Section 1 and proof in Sections 2-5](solution.md) give the explicit bounds

```math
\left\lfloor\frac m2\right\rfloor\le T_{\min}(m,\delta)\le m\quad(m\ge2),
\qquad T_{\min}(0,\delta)=T_{\min}(1,\delta)=1.
```

**Prior work and exact scope.** Cheon, Kim and Kim's [ASIACRYPT 2020 work](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-64834-3_8), especially Lemma 3 and its constant-factor complexity analysis, already yields uniform constant-factor order by combination with the classical degree bound. The optimized cubic is the earlier [Chen-Chow construction, equations (3.3)-(3.6)](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/papers/P5059-0114.pdf), also discussed in [Polar Express, Appendix F](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.16932v5). The present self-contained note supplies the explicit comparison $`T_{\min}\le m`$; it claims neither a new cubic iteration nor first discovery of constant-factor optimality. The exact smallest stage count, the optimal leading constant, and the stronger source question comparing the errors at the same multiplication budget remain unanswered.

**Verification.** A separate [independent Codex-agent mathematical and scope review](../../references/stepaniants-mf02-2026-09-12/verification/independent-review/MF-02-independent-review.md) returned PASS for the theorem and the literal canonical asymptotic-order target. A second [independent source and attribution review](../../references/stepaniants-mf02-2026-09-12/verification/source-review/REVIEW.md) confirms the scope and prior-work distinctions. The [submission record](../../references/stepaniants-mf02-2026-09-12/README.md) preserves both reviews, the original candidate and exact checks. Substantial AI assistance is disclosed. This is informal automated-agent review, not external human peer review or formal verification. No novelty or priority certification is asserted.

## Context and notation

For $`m\in\mathbb N_0`$ and $`0<\delta<1`$, put

```math
I_\delta=[-1,-\delta]\cup[\delta,1].
```

Let $`\mathcal P_m`$ consist of real polynomials computed from $`1,x`$ by
straight-line programs using at most $`m`$ nonscalar multiplications; real linear
combinations cost nothing. Define

```math
E_m(\delta)=\inf_{p\in\mathcal P_m}
\max_{x\in I_\delta}|p(x)-\mathop{\mathrm{sign}}\nolimits(x)|.
```

The arithmetic model concerns a single polynomial identity valid for matrices of every size.

## Problem statement

Define

```math
C_T(\delta)=\inf_{a_t,b_t\in\mathbb R}
\max_{x\in I_\delta}|(q_T\circ\cdots\circ q_1)(x)-\mathop{\mathrm{sign}}\nolimits(x)|,
\qquad q_t(x)=a_tx+b_tx^3.
```

Determine the asymptotic dependence on $`m,\delta`$ of

```math
T_{\min}(m,\delta)=\inf\{T\in\mathbb N_0:C_T(\delta)\le E_m(\delta)\},
```

where the empty composition is $`x`$ and $`\inf\varnothing=+\infty`$.
Each stage costs at most two matrix products.

## Scope

[MF-01](../MF-01/README.md) asks for an optimum value over general evaluation programs.
This problem measures the price of a particular, reusable composition architecture;
the two tasks are related but have different requested outputs.

## Audit — 2026-09-10

Rechecked [Problem 6.5](https://arxiv.org/html/2602.05394v3#S6.SS3) and the [degree-eight paper's concluding discussion](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.24701v1). The optimal composition comparison remains posed. Searches for cubic and recursive sign-expansion improvements found no resolution of this exact multiplication-overhead target.
