# MF-16 — Uniqueness of positive definite solutions of two-letter word equations in order two

**Topic:** Structured nonlinear matrix equations.  
**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to specialist  
**Rating rationale:** Challenging because uniqueness must hold for words of unbounded length despite higher-dimensional failures; specialist impact reflects the surviving two-letter, order-two setting.  
**Last checked:** 2026-09-11  
**Status:** Solved

**Author:** Matthew J. Colbrook, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge. **Independent Codex-agent review: PASS for the exact target.**

The ordinary symmetric two-letter word $`XBX^{12}BX=P`$ has at least three distinct real symmetric positive definite solutions for explicit integer $`B,P`$. These are also Hermitian positive definite solutions, refuting the canonical universal uniqueness assertion in dimension two. An exact negative Jacobian determinant and two independent interval implementations certify the counterexample.

The complete target is resolved. Its former difficulty rating is historical; the original statement, references and dated audits remain below.

## Problem statement

A word $`W(X,B)`$ is a finite product of letters from $`\{X,B\}`$. It is symmetric if its sequence of letters equals its reversal. Require at least one occurrence of $`X`$.

For every such symmetric word $`W`$ and every pair of Hermitian positive definite matrices $`B,P\in\mathbb C^{2\times2}`$, is there exactly one Hermitian positive definite matrix $`X\in\mathbb C^{2\times2}`$ satisfying

```math
W(X,B)=P?
```

Products are evaluated in the written order. Existence is known; uniqueness is the open assertion. This is the ordinary two-letter word case of the surviving order-two conjecture, with no real powers or additional fixed letters included in the statement.

## Why it matters

The question concerns whether a structured nonlinear matrix equation has a single positive definite solution branch. The elementary word $`XBX`$ connects this family with matrix geometric means and Riccati equations.

## Status check

On 2026-09-08, searched the titles, “symmetric word equations”, “Conjecture 11.5”, “2 × 2”, “two-by-two”, “uniqueness”, “counterexample”, and 2025–2026. No order-two resolution was located. Armstrong–Hillar refute unrestricted uniqueness in dimensions at least three, while explicitly retaining the order-two conjecture; their special order-two theorem and known bounded-degree results do not cover every word. No recent explicit reaffirmation was found. The statement deliberately records the source-backed two-letter problem rather than presuming that the paper's comments about reducing complex matrices to real matrices cover arbitrarily many fixed letters.

## Audit — 2026-09-10

Rechecked [Armstrong–Hillar, Theorem 11.4 and Conjecture 11.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0507306). The nontrivial word $`XBX^2B^3X^2BX`$ is settled in order two, but arbitrary words remain open. Title and order-two uniqueness searches found no full resolution. Existence alone is not the reason for the partial-resolution tag.
