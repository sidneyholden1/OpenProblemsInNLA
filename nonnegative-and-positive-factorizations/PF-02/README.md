**Difficulty:** challenging  
**Importance:** interesting to the community  
**Rating rationale:** Challenging because topology of optimal PSD factorizations must be controlled beyond size two; community importance concerns nonuniqueness and separated solution families in constrained factorization algorithms.  
**Status:** Lean verified  
**Area:** geometry of constrained matrix factorizations

## Resolution — 2026-09-11

**Author:** Matthew J. Colbrook, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge. **Independent Codex-agent review: PASS for the exact target.**

A strictly positive integer $`6\times6`$ matrix has ordinary rank six and real positive semidefinite rank three, while its minimal-factor congruence quotient is disconnected. A continuous congruence-invariant orientation takes opposite signs on two explicit factorizations, proving actual disconnectedness in the required quotient topology. Further constructions cover every factor size $`k\ge3`$, including strictly positive rational examples by a nonquantitative perturbation argument.

The complete target is resolved. Its former difficulty rating is historical; the original statement, references and dated audits remain below.

## Lean verification — 15 September 2026

**Formalization:** Sidney Holden, with OpenAI Codex assistance. Matthew J. Colbrook retains authorship of the mathematical argument.

The complete original question has a formally verified negative answer: the explicit positive six-by-six matrix has ordinary rank six and minimal real PSD factor size three, and its entire congruence quotient is disconnected in the specified topology. All nine reviewed statements passed kernel-only LeanCert trust audits, standard-axiom checks, and [fresh isolated Linux Comparator/default-kernel verification](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/actions/runs/34921326342) at the [immutable proof revision](https://github.com/sidneyholden1/OpenProblemsInNLA/tree/61dae15457a532be05a9a54d8e1e4040fbefddbd/nonnegative-and-positive-factorizations/PF-02/lean). The optional all-size extensions are not part of this formalization.

Two independent statement reviews preceded proof implementation; two independent final code reviews passed. [Proof, reviews and metadata](lean/README.md) · [retained Linux evidence](../../docs/lean/verification-2026-09-15/PF-02/README.md). Rejection and sandbox controls passed; no external human peer review, official Tau Ceti endorsement or source-author endorsement is claimed.

## Context and notation

Write $`\mathbb S_+^k`$ for the cone of real symmetric positive semidefinite $`k\times k`$ matrices. For an entrywise nonnegative matrix $`M\in\mathbb R_+^{p\times q}`$, its **real positive semidefinite rank** is

```math
\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\nolimits_{\rm psd}(M)
=\min\{k\ge1:\ \exists A_1,\ldots,A_p,B_1,\ldots,B_q\in\mathbb S_+^k,\quad
M_{ij}=\mathop{\mathrm{tr}}\nolimits(A_iB_j)\ \text{for all }i,j\}.
```

This definition concerns a family of matrix factors indexed by the rows and columns of $`M`$.

## Problem statement

Let $`k\ge3`$ and $`p,q\ge1`$ be integers. Suppose $`M\in\mathbb R_+^{p\times q}`$ satisfies

```math
\mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\nolimits(M)=\frac{k(k+1)}2,
\qquad \mathop{\mathrm{rank}}\nolimits_{\rm psd}(M)=k.
```

Let $`\mathcal F_k(M)`$ be the set of all tuples $`(A_1,\ldots,A_p,B_1,\ldots,B_q)`$ in $`(\mathbb S_+^k)^{p+q}`$ satisfying $`\mathop{\mathrm{tr}}\nolimits(A_iB_j)=M_{ij}`$ for every $`i,j`$. Give it the Euclidean subspace topology. Identify tuples under the changes of basis

```math
A_i\longmapsto S^\mathsf T A_iS,\qquad
B_j\longmapsto S^{-1}B_jS^{-\mathsf T},
\qquad S\in GL(k,\mathbb R).
```

Give the resulting orbit space the quotient topology.

### Question

Is $`\mathcal F_k(M)/GL(k,\mathbb R)`$ connected for every $`M`$ satisfying these hypotheses?

The ordinary-rank hypothesis is part of the problem. The case $`k=2`$ is known to be connected. The question asks whether optimal factors can belong to separated families after changes of basis are identified.

## Status check — 2026-09-10

Rechecked [Fawzi et al., §9.2, Problem 9.4](https://arxiv.org/html/1407.4095), including the ordinary-rank hypothesis, and searched for connectedness of PSD factorization orbits. No resolution for k at least three was located. The proved k=2 case is excluded here; disconnected nonnegative factorizations do not automatically remain disconnected in the PSD orbit space. No recent primary reaffirmation of the exact higher-size question was found.
